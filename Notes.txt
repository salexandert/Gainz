2023 Sold Unlinked & Quantity Sold = [.8253, 0.84236876, 0.84236876, .8253] Before Import. 
Import amount is 3.5515
3.5515 + .8253 = 4.3768
After Import [3.5515, 3.5685, 3.5685, 3.56]  
Difference [0, .017, .01, .01]
Should be [4.3763, 4.3923]

Quantity Sold Unlinked 2023 = 0.82537345  all time = 0.84236876 Difference = .017 which is greater than .009
Quantity Sold Unlinked 2023 = 0.82537345  all time = 0.84236876 Difference = .017 which is greater than .009
