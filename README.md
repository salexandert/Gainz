# Gainz App: A Cryptocurrency cost basis tool that’s offline and private

Gainz is made to be used fully offline and disconnected from the internet to maintain privacy.

Gainz will import exchange transactions CSV(s) then guide you through some common scenarios to provide clarity and insights into your crypto holdings and associated gains or losses.

Reports can be exported in excel format for your reference and shareability.

How Gainz Works:
Gainz uses Universal Wallet for accounting. This means it does not matter where the crypto resides sells can be linked to buys even if there was no transfer between wallets. This greatly simplifies cost basis calculation bypassing the need to import all xpubs, addresses, and transactions mapping the movement of coins overtime. We only are interested in taxable events. By importing exchange csv’s and entering in known off exchange occurrences (like that time you used shapeshift to convert ETH to BTC) we can make a best effort cost basis calculation. What we need to know is outside of everything entered into Gainz did you buy, sell, convert, gift, lose your coins? Gainz uses the data entered, including HODL (if provided) to true up discrepancies. An example of a common discrepancy is based on data provided you bought 3 BTC, sold 1, HODL 1. This indicates that you sold, converted, gifted, or lost 1 BTC. You can manually enter what happened by adding a transaction or Gainz can convert sends into sells or lost to resolve
